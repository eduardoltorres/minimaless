  The Leap Of Faith is the journal of a web developer.
  I have been documenting my self-teaching journey since the beginning.
  Two months later, I have succeded in undergoing over 60 hours of web development training, creating over 20 projects using over 10 different web development technologies, and connecting with other web developers and entrepeneurs. As I'm writing this, I am continously growing. 
  This is the story of how I took a leap of faith into the web development world. **This** is my story.
