Isn't it obvious? Obviously! But that's also why you didn't look.

Yesterday, I had one of the most enlightening episodes of my self-teaching journey and it was thanks to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xmtHa83sY) (it is from a year ago, but I think it's accurate).

All this time, I have been looking **EVERYWHERE** for a web developer roadmap: GitHub, Medium, Twitter. I have even emailed influencing web developers such as [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/) and [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) (who replied saying he would do a podcast on this so stay tuned to [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)). However, do you know where I didn't look: Google and YouTube. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I know, right? And yesterday I did.

My message is clear: **SEARCH WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR**, even in the most obvious places.

Resources wise, I think these are the best roadmaps you'll find online:
