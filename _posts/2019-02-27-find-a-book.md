Here it is: version 1 of my [book finder](https://upbeat-newton-ab95e5.netlify.com/)!

I'm pretty happy with it, specially with the design. I will try to implement some unit testing and routing between tomorrow and Friday, but the core functionality is there. I'm obviously learning a ton.

_Curious fact:_ I find it oddly satisfying to debug CSS. It feels so good to spot and eliminate those extra and unnecessary lines of code. Ahhh, it feels so good to **DRY** up that code! üòå

In other news, tomorrow I will take a test for a job I applied to on Sunday. I will definitely keep you posted on that.

That's all for now. ‚úåÔ∏è
