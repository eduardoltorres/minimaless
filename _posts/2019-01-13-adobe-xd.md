These past days I've been talking about web designing. Yesterday, while on the plane, I tried playing (for the second time) with [Adobe Xd](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). I say "tried" because the first time, there wasn't much chemistry between us both. However, I must say that this time we clicked.

Because I wasn't able to really concentrate on current projects ([again]({{site.url}}/my-airplane-workflow/)), I ended up taking the built-in 10 step tutorial. **Nice!!**

Just learning about fundamental features like custom assets, prototyping, and screencasting the prototype was enough to spark my interest for Adobe Xd. I'm going to keep experimenting with it for my next projects.

#### What I've Been Doing
I've been listening a lot to [Syntax](https://syntax.fm). I think that at this pace I will listen to all of their episodes. Since we've been talking about designing, I'll share with you the design tips for web developers [episode](https://syntax.fm/show/068/design-tips-for-developers).

Also, I'm still working on my daily exercises, CSS grid tutorial and current projects.
