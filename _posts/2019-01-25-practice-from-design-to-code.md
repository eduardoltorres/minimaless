I'll make this a very short one. I just want to share a resource with you on challenges regarding translating design into code. The website is called [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Check out the [challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) and the list of [resources](https://www.frontendmentor.io/resources) which is insane!! ðŸ˜± 

Have fun! ðŸ™‚
