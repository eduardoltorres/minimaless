##### On The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp:

Today was pretty cool! It was all about AJAX. This is definitely a big step towards a more complete and advanced website development. This is all about communicating with APIs and manipulating elements in the DOM. For the moment, I haven’t been able to share my progress with you, but as soon as possible I will update those previous posts and let you know through mail. Today, at least, I’ll share the codepen of the [FetchAPI profile generator](https://codepen.io/eduardoltorres/pen/eQEyjr?editors=1010). It’s pretty simple. You just click &#8220;next profile&#8221; and it updates all of the user’s information. It&#8217;s a bootcamp exercise. If you’re reading this blog post today on the 17th, the code only generates the name of the user, but tomorrow it should be finished.

##### On Bootcamps:

The more I read on bootcamps, the less I feel like paying for one. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying they’re garbage, but I don’t think they would add too much value for me at this moment. At least not the +$3,000 that they cost. At this moment I’m already training full-time, following an online and rather intensive course. The course is basically tool bombarding, but it seems that that’s not so different from bootcamps. This is the experience that a self-taught—but then bootcamp student—web developer [shared](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-landed-a-full-stack-developer-job-without-a-tech-degree-or-work-experience-6add97be2051). I just feel like I feel the same way as he did when he was in the bootcamp: I have lots of tools so now it’s my responsibility to learn how to use them.
