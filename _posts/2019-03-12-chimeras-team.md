So yesterday I met my [Chingu](https://chingu.io)) team: **The Chimeras**. 🐲 (I love that name. I can't stop saying it).

I'll just summarize how they are in one word: **AWESOME**. I have the greatest vibe that we're going to do something amazing or at the very least, have a great relationship.

At the moment, we have set up a Trello board for brainstorming project ideas and set a meeting for tomorrow evening. Over at the Discord chat we've been having "water cooler" conversations and what not. So far, I am confident to say that Chingu is an experience I will never forget.
