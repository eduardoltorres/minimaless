*If you haven't read my post on the awesome mentoring session I had with [Joe](https://joeprevite.com/), check it [here]({{site.url}}/pair-programming). This post is kind of a continuation.*

Today I created a job posting on [Craiglist](https://craiglist.org); a profile on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/); and communicated my interest in volunteering with: 2 local tech communities (I posted on their Slack channels and scrabbled their Facebook); and an international nonprofit organization.

*Awaiting responses...*

On the same note I still have for these next days:
- Create a profile for [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/), [SkillValue](https://skillvalue.com/en), and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)
- Reach out to a local business and offer to redo their website (I already saw the one)
- Contribute to an open source project (I was looking to contribute to a local organization, but GitHub is definitely on the list too)

Tomorrow will be exciting! I have:
- Pair programming with the Gatsby team (go [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/pair-programming/#pair-programming) if you're interested in doing that too)
- A collaboration meetup
- [CodeNewbie Chat](https://www.codenewbie.org/chat) on Twitter

Sweet! That's some next level networking right there. I'll definitely keep you posted on that.

Like always, I hope that you found something useful here. Have a nice one! ðŸ™‚
