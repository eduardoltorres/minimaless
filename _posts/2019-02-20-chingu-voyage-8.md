Because curiosity itches, if you don't know what Chingu is, you can go check it out [here](https://chingu.io/) and then come back.

TL;DR: a team of remote web developers is created and they build something.

Chingu provides the environment. But TBH, it is not completely clear to me **EXACTLY** what Chingu does.

Many of us starting out frequently get the advice to "pair program", but "with who?", "what do we build?", "will I really learn enough?" or "what if I know more than the other person?" Chingu attemps to solve all these issues.

So if you're starting out and want to connect with other web developers in a more _real_ working environment sense, maybe take a shot with me at Chingu! If it doesn't call your attention, but would like to know more then just wait because I will continue to share my experience. :) In any case, [here](https://chingu.io/apply) is the application form.
