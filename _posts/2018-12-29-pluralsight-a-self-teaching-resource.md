Have you ever tried [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) for learning web development? I think it is underrated.

Before I started studying web development and I was researching on how to start, I remember [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) talked about it a lot. Today I tried it for the first time.

I started with the [React path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/react) and I have to admit that I like it. If you're used to Udemy courses, it is a slightly different way of teaching and I think I already prefer Pluralsight.

The cool thing about the *Paths* is that each module is different and most of the time taught by different instructors. This gives you a breather from their styles and since they're not so long, it's always refreshing. This is also beneficial because it gives you different perspectives of the technology you're studying.

If you haven't tried Pluralsight, I recommend you go and sign up for the free trial. I'm not paid to promote them or anything like it. I just think it's worth trying.

If you do, let me know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_eduardoltorres) or send me an email at eltorrescuesta@gmail.com, I'd love to hear what you have to say.
