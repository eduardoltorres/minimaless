[Yesterday]({{site.url}}/reaction-commerce) I mentioned that I am dedicating my time to delving deeper into JavaScript with [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), learning about algorithms and data structures with [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass), among other things. Since most of the time I forget what I learned and find myself revisiting the course, I decided to take notes. In **markdown**.

I like it because I can stay in my code editor. This means several cool things for me: I feel like I'm coding; [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) does an awesome job formatting the text; and writing down code as part of the notes is a piece of cake üç∞I really like it.

Also, there is a nice markdown editor called [Typora](https://typora.io). I use it to preview my notes.

My faithful companion during these sessions is this amazing [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Try it! It's pretty cool! üôÇ
