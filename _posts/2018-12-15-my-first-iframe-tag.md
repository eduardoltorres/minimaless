There is always a first time and today was my first time using an `<iframe>` tag.

From the experience I had with it, there was nothing extraordinary.

The embedding code for a YouTube video is an `<iframe>` with inline width and height styles. Keep in mind: these fixed properties are **not** responsive. So go to your CSS and add those `@media` queries.

In other news, a big achievement for me: my portfolio will be out tomorrow. After more than a week of hard work, at last...!

Lastly--and this one's for real (I hope)--the Leap Of Faith 2.0 is almost out. This post is the first to be originally written in markup language. What's left before launching the new Leap Of Faith is: updating the previous posts to markup, tweaking a few of the theme's styles, adding a subscription form, and **maybe** opening the blog for comments.

Should I allow for comments?
