If you have heard this one and don't know what it is, worry not. I learned **today**.

After seeing this PWA term be thrown around on Twitter and other places, I finally got it. Actually, I just built my first PWA the same day I found out what it was!

Instead of giving you a technical definition, I will just give you the caveman definition: _you know when you're browsing on your phone and the tab of the website has a fancy color? Or you know when you visit a webpage and a box pops up at the bottom of the window asking you if you want to add that website to your phone's homepage?_

That's a PWA.

Like I said, if you want a more technical definition, **just Google it**. Ha! I said it. I always look over my shoulder people that say that. How can that be kind in any way? ðŸ‘€ps, sorry. I guess I vented a little bit there ðŸ˜… But mine was funny at least, right?

Jokes aside, if you use **React**, chances are you already know what PWAs are. But if you are like me and didn't know, as of now `create-react-app` comes with a `manifest.json`, some `<meta>` tags and other stuff related to this. It's very obvious so you'll notice it. Their documentation is nice.

So if you want to build your PWA, go `create-react-app` now and read that documentation. It's fun and easy :)

P.S. I almost forgot, [here](https://upbeat-newton-ab95e5.netlify.com/) is my PWA ðŸ˜„
