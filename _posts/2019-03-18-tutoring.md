Oh wait, I didn't tell you? Last week I got accepted as a HTML/CSS and JavaScript tutor at [Wyzant](https://wyzant.com)! ðŸŽ‰ Check out [my tutor profile](https://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/EduardoL). Looking good, I know! ðŸ˜Ž

Today, I will be tutoring my second hour with the previous student. Although my intention was to tutor complete beginners, the current student is already studying React. I will help whenever possible, specially if students find my lessons helpful. As always, I will try to give my best.
