I've decided to move on with the [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com) course I've had in the drawer for a while now.

Yesterday, [our team]({{site.url}}/chimeras-team) met for the first time and we decided on the project we will build and the tech stack we will use. I don't want to talk about the project too much for now, but I will say that we've decided to use React, MongoDB, and GraphQL. That's why I've decided to start with the Advanced React course.

We have decided that this first sprint (Sprint 0) of the [Chingu Voyage]({{site.url}}/chingu-voyage-8) will be for defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), designing a mockup of the app, translating that design into components, designing the backend, and designing the git workflow. Sounds like a lot, you're right. This sprint lasts **1 week**.

We'll see how this goes!
