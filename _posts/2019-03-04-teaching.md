The other day I stumbled upon Tenzin's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPmgYBc6rG4&t=768s) on how to make \$1,000 per month with code. Humble, I know. But how? **Teaching**.

If you'd like, go and watch the video but I will summarize it for you: **teach**. Create a profile on tutoring platforms like [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/) or [takelessons](https://takelessons.com/), give it some love and start teaching. That's it.

He recommends having at least +200 hours of experience with whatever it is that you're going to teach.

I felt very excited about the idea. Not only because it can be income, but I actually like the idea of teaching!

If you feel confident with the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, JavaScript or, heck, it doesn't even have to be programming, you might want to check it out. They have a nice and friendly website.

Cheers!
