The most fun part first: check out the clock [here](https://eduardoltorres.github.io/countdown-clock/). [This](https://github.com/eduardoltorres/countdown-clock) is the repo if you want to check out the code.

One of my queued JavaScript projects was a countdown clock. Sadly (kind of), the result got spoiled by today's [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com) project. However, I plan on adding functionality.

I probably will:
- implement a pomodoro feature üçÖ
- add a reset button

If you have projects, even if you coded along, **add functionality** to them. That is great practice, really.

I have a project coming out soon. I'll keep you posted!
