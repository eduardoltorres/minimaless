_This post is mainly for those with at least a basic knowledge of CSS Grid_

When I was starting out with grid, initially it wasn't so clear to me the difference between `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`.

These explanations did it for me:

> `Auto-fill` **FILLS** the row with as many columns as it can fit. So it creates implicit columns whenever a new column can fit, because it's trying to **FILL** the row with as many columns as it can. The newly added columns can and may be empty, but they will still occupy a designated space in the row.

> `Auto-fit` **FITS** the **CURRENTLY AVAILABLE** columns into the space by expanding them so that they take up any available space. The browser does that after **FILLING** that extra space with extra columns (as with auto-fill) and then collapsing the empty ones.

#### What I've Been Doing

I've continued my review on Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose like I said [yesterday]({{site.url}}/focus-on-the-80-not-the-100).

Also, I have continued to work on my resume and cover letter to start applying for jobs.

Lastly, I am competing for a contest that could be called "Most Questions Answered from The Web Developer Bootcamp's Q&A."

The way it works is that every other day, the course's TA posts a lists of question on the course's Discord channel and you have about 8 hours to answer as much as possible. The one who answers the most questions by the end of the week earns \$20 and at the moment I'm at 1st place ðŸ˜‚

Like always, I will keep you posted!
