Three months ago, [I took the leap]({{site.url}}/leap-of-faith-beginnings).

I was full of energy, motivation and excitement to begin this journey. My goal was to become a web developer and get a job in less than three months. Today is **d-day**.

"Where's the job?"

I didn't get it...yet.

This is but the beginning.

I have learned many things which I won't list here because I've already posted about them and because you can see them for yourself in my [portfolio](http://www.eduardoltorres.com).

But I will say one thing: taking this leap has been the best thing I've done in my life. I don't regret it and I don't think I ever will.

This journey has not ended. I will thrive.

**Happy anniversary**, The Leap of Faith!ðŸ–¤
