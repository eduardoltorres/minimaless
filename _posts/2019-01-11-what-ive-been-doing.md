On [yesterday's post]({{site.url}}/how-to-create-an-array-of-a-specific-length/), I made a section on "What I've Been Doing". You'll probably see this more often.

After a mental dillema on whether to blog about specific web development techniques, tips and tricks, or journaling my story, I think I'll do both. The posts will probably be titled with the technical topic I'll be dealing with first, followed by a section on what I did or learned that day. This way I can teach and learn, you can learn, and I continue documenting my story. ðŸ™‚

#### What I've Been Doing
I am working on the pomodoro timer. I've made it *ultra* simple in order for the user to focus on working and doesn't get distracted on learning how to use the app. It should be out in the next two days (way sooner than I expected!).
