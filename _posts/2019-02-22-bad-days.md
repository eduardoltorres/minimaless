Have you ever had one of those days where your code simply doesn't work? Frustrating **AF**. Today was one of those days for me.

I have started building an app for the Pre-Work Phase of the [Chingu](https://chingu.io) Voyage-8. It is a Google Books finder built with React...and **NOTHING** wanted to work (excuse my tone, but this has been frustrating).

I am being overly dramatic for the sake of obviousness. I just want to note, for the record, that this happens to every one. But you know what? After hours, things started to work. And this felt better than quenching my thirst after a long hike. Okay, **as good as**...

For sure I am no expert, but with some hurt confidence I can say that the only way is just to **keep pushing**. Ugh, so cliché, I know, but I think it is a cliché for a reson (another cliché).
