After almost two months of intense hard work, I am proud to present my web developer [portfolio](http://www.eduardoltorres.com/)! ðŸŽ‰

I am happy to close 2018 with two of my biggest goals completed: publishing a portfolio with at least 6 projects **and** migrating The Leap Of Faith from WordPress to Jekyll.

For me, this is the beginning of a new stage as a web developer. Above all, what I am proud of the most is having learned so much in less than two months. A self-taught journey can feel directionless and seeing concrete results is definitely gratifying.

If I did it, so can you. Keep it up! ðŸ’ª
