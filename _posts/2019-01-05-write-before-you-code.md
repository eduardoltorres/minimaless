When you have an idea for an application, do you jump right into your text editor and start coding right on? Or do you take some time to think your idea, to *plan* it out?

Many of us, specially when starting out, get right into the code and swim in unpredictable bugs and blank staring at the monitor. 

**Write before you code**.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that this is the cure to all diseases, but I think it can cure some. Hear me out.

This could or could not be the method for you. What has worked for me is **breaking down the functionalities I want my app to have**. And then breaking them down even further. And then again and again until I have the *pure programming logic*. Eventually, my smallest bite-sized chunks become checkmarks.

It doesn't have to be anything fancy. Pen and paper never fails. You can also use tools like [Trello](https://trello.com). I use both.

This works for me because it takes out the "how do I make this work?" mental process out of the way when I'm coding. It makes you figure it out beforehand. To me, that is the hardest part of programming.

Does this work for you? [Let me know](https://twitter.com/eltorres720) what you think!
