_What the \$#%! is that?_ was my first reaction when I saw a video on setting up [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/). But I can't say I wasn't warned. Everyone I have ever spoken with about Redux told me "it's hard to pick up at the beginning, but then it will be a great tool in your belt".

_Why did you get into Redux?_, you may ask. _Weren't you just [one day ago]({{site.url}}/the-mern-stack) working with the MERN stack?_ Yes, fair. In my defense, the tutorial I am following uses Redux so I had to take a little detour to, at the very least, have an idea of what was going on. Not that I have one now...

Anyway...

As you might know or might have guessed, I write my posts in the evenings, once I'm done. Today, for personal reasons, I might work overtime, but I'm not sure if I should...take a little breather and...delve into some Linux. ðŸ‘€ The hacker in mean can't resist the temptation. I mean, sooner or later I **will** (no, I won't. I just want to) have to delve into it and I could really use a refresher from what I have been studying all day...

Alright, enough with the whining! Tomorrow, I'll let you know what I ended up doing. I mean, on Monday. ðŸ˜œ
