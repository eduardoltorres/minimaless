So I got selected to be a Project Manager (PM) for the [Chingu](https://chingu.io) Voyage! ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰

The teams should be assigned today and...it...will...start!!! ðŸŽŠ

I have a couple of things saved up to try and be the best PM I can for the benefit of my team. There is a Discord channel created only for PMs which is really cool too! I can't say how excited I am for this opportunity. Sadly, today has been a really busy day for personal reasons, and I'm going to be honest, I gotta go now. ðŸ˜‚

So tomorrow I will share in more detail (because tomorrow I will also structure a bit better what I will be doing). Later!!
