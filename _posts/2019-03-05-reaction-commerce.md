A couple of months ago, I [wrote]({{site.url}}/e-commerce) about e-commerce platforms. I didn't know which one to choose. Well, you guessed it, I started experimenting with [Reaction Commerce](https://reactioncommerce.com).

First impression: I felt like a hacker. Inevitably, you will have to get into [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). I like this because I love feeling like a hacker and because I want to get comfortable with the full-stack.

While swimming in the Reaction Commerce and Docker documentation, I realized that documentation > tutorials (I kinda talked about this on my documentation [post]({{site.url}}/using-documentation)). Like I said to another web developer: with documentation you definitely have to grind more, but you get a **better grasp**. And so I swam!

Apart from that, because I learned React from tutorials, I swam for a while in their documentation too. Lovely experience. ðŸ’™

Lastly, I have been brushing up my data structures and algorithms skills and digging a bit deeper into what JavaScript **really** is. Haven't you noticed that you can do cool things with JavaScript without really understanding what's going on? Curiously, understanding what goes _under the hood_ is what I find the most interesting.

Although I slept horribly last night, today has been a very productive day and I like where this is going. ðŸš€
