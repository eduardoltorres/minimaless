#### News!!!
The blog has just been moved to its new domain (at the moment of this post, the original blog was being hosted in a free hosting service provided by a Udemy course and the domain name was horrible)! From the feels of it, the website will be used as a sandbox for me while I’m learning. I have some ideas for the appearance of the website that my skills don’t allow me fully to execute yet but they’ve been noted and will be worked on progressively.A brief insight I had after the creation of the Leap of Faith: I think that the challenge of this whole experience is how to do it and not doing it. I know I can study full-time for 3 months with motivation, persistence, discipline and without burning out, I know. But the most difficult part is how do I study the material in such an efficient way that by 3 months I possess the knowledge required to land a job? That is the actual challenge.

I’ve been delving into articles, books (actually audiobooks) and some places more in order to keep piling up possible answers to this question. Below my memoir on these past week.

#### March 8th, 2018 at 10:20am:
During vacations abroad, I decided to formalize a bit my research on web development and how to tackle the pursuit of the marketable and profitable knowledge. Yes, I know, what was I doing thinking about work during vacations...but really, this was the only time I had available to use all my consumed-during-semester energies towards the planning of this soon to be adventure and work-life project.

#### My presence in communities:
After researching for about a week or so about self-teaching, bootcamps, communities, and not being able to sleep since 3:00am, I decided to fully join two communities: [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) and the Putty Tribe. I started with Indie Hackers by posting my first comment that went like this:

_**This is my first time seriously contributing to a productive and healthy community such as Indie Hackers so I'm really excited to be doing this. By the end of the year, there will be a change in my life that will allow me at least a 3 months gap in which I'll be able to dedicate fully to whatever I want. To me, that means embarking on the journey towards the financially and location independent life I've dreamt of and developed the skills for. I've built a few websites and have some experience with programming languages but nothing sophisticated. My intention is to dedicate full-time to the studies and practice of website development and start freelancing ASAP. Minimum or progressive income would allow me to extend the 3 months gap and therefore more time I to build, create or innovate. I will take the leap of faith.**_

**_My presence in IH is not only for the feedback of my projects or the browsing, although I totally welcome and invite feedback, I also want to contribute to other people's dreams, aspirations and projects. Once again, I'm very happy to have found IH and hope this to be the beginning of a productive and healthy stay._**

I was honest with my comment on the reason why I officially started progressively exposing my idea to the community. Skimming for a few minutes was enough evidence to show the warmness and support of the other members. So I jumped in. Curiously, after posting the comment, I saw an article suggesting to share your plans and ideas with others instead of keeping them for yourself, which received in the comments a lot of possible feedback. I also found another article of a girl that went from photographer to web developer in a few months, in which she stressed the importance of the support from a tribe. So I finally decided to join the Putty Tribe.

At the moment I wrote this blog post, I still hadn't explored the Putty Tribe because I was abroad (I was writing this as I was sitting down on a plane; and no, it was not the same one as I was sitting while writing the previous post but yes, it was the same trip) but the welcoming video from Emilie, her emails regarding the Tribe and her [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8) were definitely more than inspirational and welcoming which transmitted a sense of excitement and motivation to share my plans with the community. Introducing myself and this project was one of the first things I did when I got back home. If you don't know about the Tribe, [go check it out](http://www.theputtytribe.com)!

Once I got back home, I summoned myself in the Tribe. To be honest, I received more positive replies than I expected, not in quantity but in quality: supportive replies on the leap, peeps sharing a bit of their previous experience on similar leaps, some were so interested they even inboxed me to video chat so they could know a little bit more about this project. At the moment, I’m checking in every day and contributing to conversations in a general manner. The Tribe is definitely a place I’ll continue to hang out often.

#### On career...
I just listened to [The Dip](https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666) by Seth Godin: I loved it. The thesis of this book is simple: when to quit something or when to stick with it, strategically speaking. Basically, when you’re reaching for something or pursuing a goal, you’ll always hit a dip. The dip is similar to a bottleneck, it is that wall that’s put there (intentionally or not) for most people to walk away whenever they face it. And to be honest, I think that I might have started hitting the dip. Fear has already started creeping in regarding the leap of faith I’m taking: “are you sure you can do it?”, “what about your 3 years of law school? You’re flushing them down the toilet!”, “why not get a steady job with what you have?”, are only some of the uncalled and unintentional dialogues in my head. However, panicking time is not a smart time to quit, according to Seth Godin. This is just starting.

I’ve also started listening to [The Complete Software Developer’s Career Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Software-Developers-Career-Guide-ebook/dp/B073X6GNJ1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521931055&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=john+sonmez+guide&psc=1) by John Sonmez. I’m enjoying it so far. I think the book covers a lot and he’s really providing value. He also has a YouTube channel and a blog with courses which seem very useful. Briefly, he speaks about how to actually become a software developer, how to learn, the different paths to take in order to learn, how to land your first job, etc. I’ll keep documenting my reaction in upcoming posts.

#### The cow
Have you ever heard the story of the cow? I always ask that question when I’m going to talk about the story of the cow but I’m not sure when I read about the story, who wrote it or anything more about it. No, I won’t look for it because it’s fun not to know about the story of the cow (I just googled about it, I couldn’t stand it). Okay, on with the story. It’s very short so bear with me.

There was a family, a huge family, who lived in a small house in the rural side and whose only possession was a cow. This cow was the only thing that separated this family from actually having nothing; the cow provided, to some extent, some financial security and nutrition. That night, a spiritual master and a student stayed with them (I don’t know for what reason, just make it up, but they stayed!). The next morning the master taught the student **the** lesson: he killed the cow.

The rest of the story is not that relevant since the point is rather clear. You can guess what happened, right? Okay, it’s not that obvious. The family was forced beyond their limits to actually move and do something. While they had the cow they were static, stagnant, close to misery.

Although the story is not necessarily a masterpiece, I really like it because I believe it has some wisdom in it. I feel that, in a way, I’m killing my cow. Not that I’m close to misery (who knows?), but I’m “killing” that which holds me back from my ultimate desire or aspiration.

#### What’s next?
I think I’ve already done what I initially wanted for this first weeks: opened up with friends and with a community about the leap, uploaded the website to a not too bad domain and kept researching on self-teaching and nailing your first job.

I’ve structured my next weeks by working once every two weeks on the writing (also reviewing posts [since I really want to put it out there, I’m pushing myself to put it out there even if I miss a few mistakes] such as spell checking, adding the references I mention in the posts, etc.) and once every two weeks on the website: working on the appearance and the code (I’ll be tweaking with the code using trial and error, googling or reading documentation in order to start delving into it but not formally committing to the studies; I think this is a way to start learning way ahead of time without consuming too much energy or willpower). So expect new blog posts at least twice per month and constant changes to the website.

Thanks for reading! Until the next one!
