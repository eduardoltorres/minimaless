To aspiring web developers, I would encourage coding after each section or lesson; really getting into the code trial and error.

Of Colt Steele’s The Web developer Bootcamp: watched the sections on APIs, the basics of YelpCamp (course project), Databases (MongoDB and Mongoose), Data Persistence and RESTful Routing. It was a tough day; watching these information heavy loaded videos without practicing is definitely not ideal since they’re more referential than any other thing. Anyway, it helps to at least see their contents and then refer back to them in case of need (and there will be need).

I created my LinkedIn profile and emphasized it on computer and technology services; I felt accomplished by it. Considered the idea of coaching self-teaching aspiring web developers.
