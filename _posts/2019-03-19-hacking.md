Almost every time I read a sentence that starts with "Since I was a kid, I always...", I can't help but to roll my eyes a little. But just a little, I promise! **However**...ever since **I** was a kid (yes, I am rolling my eyes at myself...but just a little!), I _always_ wanted to be a **hacker**. So corny, I know, but I swear it's true.

I _love_ computers and I _love_ programming, but I have found myself getting less and less attracted to the problem solving of the front-end. I don't have a problem with discipline and persistence (just look at this blog for proof), but it is just not that fulfilling to spend hours trying to make a component's width resize in a specific way :S. This is a dissected example, I know, but the front-end ultimately has to do with the client side! I think I would rather spend the hours trying to figure out a different method to solve an algorithmic problem in a more efficient way. But how to know for sure?

At the same time, it just doesn't feel right to drop JavaScript, React, and everything that I have worked for to move to Python or any other programming language. I mean, I could learn it but you know what I mean...

Anyway, I am not sure if I have shared about [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)'s YouTube channel before. They also have a [website](https://liveoverflow.com/) and it is all about hacking. I also found this [hacker roadmap](https://github.com/sundowndev/hacker-roadmap). Lastly, a friend recommended [this](https://www.udemy.com/the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-information-cyber-security/) Udemy course, but only because it was cheap! ðŸ˜œ

We'll see...
