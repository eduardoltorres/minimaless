My self-teaching journey officially started 2 months and 1 week ago. I say *officially* because ever since I was a kid, I've been interested in computers and technology. Now, I'm talking about **The Leap of Faith**.

Since the beginning of this journey, my wish was to work remotely, either with a team or independently. Today, although I'm still not making money out of this, I'm working as if I was and I'm doing so remotely. Even though this is just starting, in a way, I am already living my dream life: working full-time in web development from whichever part of the world I choose.

Today, I get on a plane and I've already downloaded programming books, videos and documentation to continue my learning process. It has been 2 months and 1 week and I've kept my promise: full-time programming studies and daily blogging. My journey continues, but I am happy to say that I'm doing as I planned and I plan on continuing. Thanks for following along. Thank you.

P.S. today I finished [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com). If you're in tutorial purgatory (or not), this is a course that can give you some confidence to get out of it or teach you a few intermediate JavaScript tips and tricks. Wes Bos (the instructor) has other courses among which there is a free CSS Grid course that I've already prepared for tonight's flight :) see you tomorrow!
