*This post is really about contributing to open source, but it's called "Local Environments" because today, in order to contribute to 2 repositories, I had to install them locally. So here we go!*

One of them was [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) (previously known as HabitRPG) and the other one was [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), the React static site generator.

Previously, I had struggled big time to install Habitica locally, but today went smooth as butter (check out the repo [here](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica) in case you're interested). Sadly, I struggled to find an issue I could contribute to. Most of them seemed too complicated for me and the ones that didn't (labeled *good first issue*) were already taken. ‚òπÔ∏è

As I mentioned [yesterday]({{site.url}}/contract-positions-and-volunteer-jobs), today I had my first pair programming session with the Gatsby open commnuity pair programming [initiative](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/pair-programming/#pair-programming). It was amazing. I successfully submitted my first open source contribution to the Gatsby repo (and got invited to be a part of the maintainers team **plus** got myself a Gatsby t-shirtüòÉ); locally installed Gatsby; and got myself a few mentor tips. Thanks to [Mike Allanson](https://github.com/m-allanson) for this!

Also, I created the freelancing profiles on [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/) and [SkillValue](https://skillvalue.com/), but also read horror stories on Freelancer and SkillValue's website is acting buggy so I couldn't successfully submit my profile. üòï Maybe a sign from the universe?

Lastly, I contacted a local animal rescue shelter to volunteer on remaking their website but it seems they're not interested.

Will keep you posted. Hope these resources help!
