#### On JS30:
I did it! Two out of three challenges that I manage to figure out and solve before watching the solution. For me, that is definitely a reason to celebrate. Today’s challenge had to do with—you guessed it—CSS variables. It was simple: a boiler plate with a header, some sliders, a color picker and an image. The idea was to scale and blur the image when sliding and change the color of the image’s background and two letters from a header’s span. This was all to be done by manipulating CSS variables.

It was a simple project yet educational. I learned about the existence and practical use of CSS variables (I started using them immediately in my projects). I also practiced event listening a little bit more. One of the things I’m most proud of is the fact that the code didn’t feel WET. In fact, it even felt a bit dryer than Wes’. Although his seemed more clever.

#### On Code Wars:
I’m just making this small section to let you know that every morning, since I paused the Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp, I’ve been doing a [kata](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata). I’m doing this with the purpose of exposing myself to a greater quantity of problems that require solving. I don’t know if Code Wars’ exercises come about too weird or unrealistic problems, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like it.

#### On Building Projects:
Okay, I admit it, I cheated…but only a little bit! Remember how I was supposed to build 5 HTML/CSS pages and **then** start working with migrating the LoF and on my portfolio? Well…I’ve started working on my portfolio. But hey! Portfolio + LoF = 5, no?

Anyway, I’m super duper excited to be building my portfolio. I’m dedicating genuine and careful time to the building process. I suppose this one is going to take me a few days, maybe even a week. But that’s okay. I really don’t want to rush what I believe is going to be my best project. After that, I’ll deal with the seemingly complicated process of migrating and installing a blog someplace else. Although I might be fearing fear itself more than anything.
