#### On Portfolio:
Days with one bug. **Days**. Yup. If it has happened or is happening to you, I feel you. If it hasn't, your day will come. The way I deal with it is by taking it very slow. Not slacking, but with a lot of patience. Check every nook and cranny. Typos are the ones that make you laugh with that sarcastic tone.

Chances are that if you’re starting out (1 month or so) like me, it’s taking you a lot of time to solve a seemingly tiny problem…like me. Say solving a problem like adding a class to a navbar item whenever the section that that navbar item is pointing to is in view. That seems like a tiny problem to me. Yet it feels like it is taking me ages and it kinda is! And if you’re taking a leap of faith, like me, it adds up to the anxiety that it’s taking you longer to become a real web developer.

But what would be the other side of the coin? Not getting stuck by thoughtlessly following code alongs? If that’s your thing, cool, but I think that sooner or later you have to face that empty text editor by yourself. Code alongs don’t train you to do that. I think you should do a little bit of both. Deep inside, I believe that being stuck for days trying to debug a problem forces you to learn in a more profound way.

#### On Web Design:
Today I was speaking with a friend who’s very talented in art. We were talking about web design, web development and e-commerce. I invited him to join me as a possible partner: he designs and I code. [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/) were the resources I suggested for him to check out. If you’re an aspiring web developer, but not a designer, consider talking with a friend or colleague and try partnering up. I’m not saying it’s the best idea, but perhaps you can make the wheel move a little bit faster towards profitability.

#### On JS30:
As I mentioned earlier, I believe code alongs are good, but not by themselves. Every day I do the JS30 daily challenge. Today’s was not much of a challenge, but more like a suggestion. You know `console.log`, right? Every web developer’s best friend? Well, he has many cousins: `console.error`, `console.info`, and many others. Go check those out. They won’t be a substitute for `console.log`, but it doesn’t hurt to know them and they’re pretty straightforward.

Alright, good luck!
