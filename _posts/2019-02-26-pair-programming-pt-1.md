Today was the first pair programming session with a fellow Chingu called _Jennifer_. She was super cool and we nailed that [warm-up kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search-for-a-substring-within-a-string/train/javascript).

It was the first pair programming session for the both of us. At the beginning, she took the **driver's seat**. In pair programming lingo, this means that she took the lead and I was standing by, sharing my thoughts and googling. A few minutes later, we switched.

The kata was not hard at all. According to the [Chingu Handook](https://chingu.gitbook.io), this pair programming session was aimed at _**speaking** clearly, **listening**, and **sharing** responsibilities_. And that's what we did.

Tomorrow we will have the second session. This one will be to solve the official kata we will have to submit on our pre-work form. [Here](https://www.codewars.com/collections/chingu-challenge) is the list of exercise to choose from, in case you're interested.
