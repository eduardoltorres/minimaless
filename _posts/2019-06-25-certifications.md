In the web development and programming world there are no high esteemed certificates like there are in the IT world. I am talking about certificates such as CompTia's [A+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a) and [Network+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network) or the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) Certification for penetration testers.

Where do web developers and programmers go for "certified" education? And I am not talking about superior or university education nor bootcamps, but rather are there any parallel certifications in the programming world analogous to the ones I mentioned above? If so, which ones? And perhaps more philosophically, if not, why?

More generally speaking, how powerful are these certifications anyway? Are they there to really make you stand out or to just give you the edge in a tie break?

I am proud of my Udemy certifications because of the seriousness with which I attend these courses, but I don't think them to be analogous to the A+ or OSCP certifications.
