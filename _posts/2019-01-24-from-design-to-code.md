I haven't seen much tutorials about this around. ðŸ¤”

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gNrZ4lAnAw&t=5214s) is a good one I've been watching. However, when it comes to complicated asymmetrical layouts, I can't seem to find a guide *per se*.

Also, this reminds me of that [article](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) I've mentioned a few times: I feel I'm in **the desert of despair**. This is a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing is that I'm progressing forwards. The bad thing is that...well...I'm in despair.

...and because I'm in despair, I'm going to leave it here and continue working on a few unsolved problems that robbed my sleep last night.

At what stage do you think you are? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eltorres720).
