I've always struggled to center items with a fixed width. Every time I set a specific width for an element I was never quite sure how to bring it to the middle. Often, I ended up changing my design idea to avoid dealing with the issue.

Today I re-discovered the solution: `margin: 0 auto;`. This is one of the first things they show you in an HTML/CSS course. If you want to center an item with a fixed width, regardless of whether you're using **grid** or **flexbox**, setting the side margins to `auto` will give you what you want.

#### What I've Been Doing
[This](https://eduardoltorres.github.io/pomodoro/) is my first version of my pomodoro timer and [this](https://github.com/eduardoltorres/pomodoro) is the repo in case you want to check it out. Like I said before, it is very simple and focused on the functionality, although the design might change in the next few days.

Just like every other day, yesterday I was reflecting on the web developer I want to become: "on what kinds of projects would I like to be working on? Is it web pages or web apps that I want to be building? Is it both? Do I prefer front-end or back-end? How important is design for me?" These are some of the questions that I was asking myself. This is an ongoing exercise for me, meaning that I've been asking and will probably continue to ask myself these and related questions.

*"But what about the answers?*, you might ask. Well, I know and I don't know. Because I want to work remotely I have two roads: working remotely for a **private company** or **freelancing**. These roads have their own tangents but that's what it is, generally speaking.

If my goal is working for a **private company**, then I think that design is not **that** important and that I should focus more on trendy technologies such as React. On the other side, if my goal is **freelancing**, perhaps it's best to be able to build nice looking projects and focus on the technologies I like the most instead of on the trendiest. At the moment, I gravitate more towards freelancing although I do not discard any possibilities or opportunities.

(I just made a 1-hour pause to research about freelancing and my thoughts are still the same)
