**On The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp:** I’m going to keep this one short and sweet. I’ve been hammering on some advanced (at least for me) JavaScript topics called asynchronous functions. I was playing all day on the console with callback functions, higher order functions, forEach functions, and findIndex functions. I also spent some time learning about the stack, the heap and the queue in order to understand concepts like promises and promise chaining. Lastly, I made a few exercises with the setTimeout and setInterval methods. I wonder if it’s worth it to go so deep into these topics instead of starting to build projects with the knowledge I know. To acquire more knowledge and build or to build and then acquire more knowledge? Both? I think I should haven an answer by December 1st the latest. Maybe building a few startup pages to start...I’m thinking about it. Maybe I should have an answer sooner.
