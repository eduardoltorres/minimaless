**Take tutorials when you're stuck.**

_*Drops the mic and walks away*_

_*Comes back*_

No, but seriously, **don't take programming tutorials just for taking them** (unless you want to, obviously).

This advice is mainly aimed at those of us who are surviving in the self-teaching jungle, trying to make a career out of it.

I have spent way more hours than I should have by watching tutorials.

Now don't get me wrong, I have learned a lot, but I think I would have learned more if I had focused on **building more**.

Watch a little bit, build, and then watch more **OR** read documentation, build, and then watch tutorials. These are approaches I recommend more than just watching tutorials or going from course to course just coding along.

Don't feel bad if that's what you've done. It's not lost time. You can always go back to these courses and modify these projects to make them originally yours.

If you like designing and front-end, then modify the CSS, design a new layout or add some cool UI animations. If you prefer back-end, then add some back-end functionalities: implement an authentication functionality or connect it to some API or geolocation service.

You don't have to spend months on this. Maybe set a few days or a week per project and by the end of the month you'll have at least 3-4 projects of your own that you can showcase on your portfolio.

#### What I've Been Doing

I have decided to start applying for jobs.

Honestly, I believe I have what it takes to tackle web develoment challenges, problem solve, and to teach myself what I don't know. I might not have +30 years of experience (I'm not even 30), but I am 100% confident in my potential that I have what it takes to be an asset.

As always, I will definitely keep you posted. :)
