It&#8217;s been about a month since my last post, and not two weeks like I promised. This is due to burnout. I won&#8217;t make this a long post about what burnout is or if it exists or not (there is actually a debate on that). This post is just to let you guys know that due to burnout and school I&#8217;ve paused the Leap of Faith.

At the beginning, I mentioned that my main goal as of now was school. As finals have been approaching, I&#8217;ve been spending more time working and in consequence more time recuperating. I also mentioned that what I was doing for the LOF was basically bonus because the three months haven&#8217;t started yet. That being said, I&#8217;m **NOT** quitting the LOF. This is just a temporary pause or slow down until I finish what I started. The LOF plan, as it was originally stated, is still running. If you&#8217;ve been following the leap, stay tuned because more will come. If you&#8217;re new, stay tuned as well, the best is yet to arrive.
