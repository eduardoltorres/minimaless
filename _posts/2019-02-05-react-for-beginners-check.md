Remember yesterday's [checklist]({{site.url}}/create-checklists)? Well, of course I have my own.

First on the list: completing the [React For Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course. However, I failed to deploy it in all 3 options that the course shows: [Now](https://zeit.co/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and an Apache server. Deploying is tomorrow's item. Or...well...next time's item.

These next days I'm going to be flying (✈️) so my blog posting and workflow might be a bit funky until I settle. And even though you know I don't enjoy much [working on planes]({{site.url}}/my-airplane-workflow), I will get something done, I just don't know what yet.

I will keep you posted. Until the next one!
