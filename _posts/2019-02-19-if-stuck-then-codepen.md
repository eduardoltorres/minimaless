Don't know what Codepen is? Go [check it out](https://codepen.io/) and then comeback.

If you ever feel overwhelmed by your code in your text editor...or if you're failing to implement a new feature and don't want to mess up your current code or something along those lines, **use Codepen**.

You can definitely checkout a different git branch, but if you're not familiar with git and you're just starting out, then Codepen can be a nice alternative for you. Further on, you can get into git.
