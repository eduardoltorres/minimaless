[Yesterday]({{site.url}}/chingu-voyage-8), I was checking out project ideas to build with React. [This](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) is what I found. Honestly, it re-sparked my motivation.

I quickly built the social card and then moved to a personal project I talked about with a friend.

There's a limit to what I can share about this project. The only thing I will say is that it is _ultra_ adequate for where I am right now. In terms of difficulty, it is challenging in a healthy way. It pushes me out of my comfort zone but I know how to guide myself. And if it's not obvious yet, I am building it with **React**.

After 4 hours more or less, its functionality is starting to make some sense. It feels great to build something that works.
