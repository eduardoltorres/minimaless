If you're listening for a 'click' on multiple nested elements, the default of `addEventListener` is to ripple all the way up. This is called **bubbling**.

When you click on an element, the browswer **captures** each element from the outermost to the innermost (the one you clicked) and then *bubbles* up from the innermost to the outermost.

If you want to focus on the capture and not the bubbling, pass a third and optional `options` parameter.

```javascript
elements.forEach(element => {
  element.addEventListener('click', yourFunction, { capture: true }
}));
```

Alternatively, you can also call `stopPropagation()` on the `MouseEvent` frequently called `e` (this is done inside the callback function being passed as second parameter of the event listener). This would only fire that specific element you clicked **if** the `capture` option is set to `false`, which is its default. If you use `stopPropagation` in conjunction with `capture: true`, it would fire the outermost element of the nested elements regardless of which one you clicked.

Lastly, there is another option we can add to the last parameter called `once`. If set to `true`, once clicked, the elements will unbind themselves, meaning that clicking on them would only work once.

```javascript
elements.forEach(element => {
  element.addEventListener('click', yourFunction, { capture: false, once: true }
}));
```

If you want hands-on practice with this, I suggest you open your console and start typing away or check out day 25 of [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com).
