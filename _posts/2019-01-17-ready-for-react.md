If you've been following along this journey, you know that one of the biggest difficulties for me has been figuring out the **right** road to take. My road has always been to become a great web developer, but the road to get there constantly changes.

I call the most difficult moments, at which to decide which way to take, **knowledge crossroads**. At this point, you know enough about one thing to decide what to learn next. The problem is that to decide what to learn next you kind of have to have an idea of what you'll want to learn next and next and next...

**Now, I'm at another crossroad.**

In a [previous post]({{site.url}}/goals-2019), I shared an image of a Trello board which contained the technologies I wanted to master in order to become the web developer I wanted to be. You guessed it, this changed too. I think the word "change" gives it a bad connotation; I shall say, it **evolved**.

So, what's the road I am taking now? Once again, I feel like I face the giant: React. The question is not anymore whether I should learn React. I already decided it: I **will** learn it. But am I ready?

The answer to this question is debatable. Some say I am, some say I am not.

[Tenzin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0tRdbXVDbhaRvZPKsRgmxg) says I am not, [Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) says I am.

Tenzin says these are the technologies and skills I **should** (not **have to**) be familiar or comfortable with before getting into React:
- HTML/CSS (responsive)
- JavaScript
- Command Line, Git and GitHub
- JavaScript (including ES6 and the basics of OOP)
- *According to Tenzin, at this point, I should've built simple projects like a clock, a countdown timer, and a rock, paper, scissors*
- Sass *(this is where I am right now...)*
- APIs *(...although I've already worked with APIs...)*
- Gulp
- Webpack
- Node *(...and a little bit with Node)*
- *At this point, he suggests teaching and freelancing*
- Deeper CSS and JS
- *Now, he suggests you build simple JS components such as tooltips or sliding navbars*
- CSS Design Patterns
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- JS Design Patterns
- React

On the contrary, Traversy says that after being familiar with **HTML/CSS (responsive)**, **basic deployment**, **Sass**, and **Vanilla JS (ES6)** one is ready to begin with React.

I think the truth often lies in between. Perhaps Traversy's suggestion is too lenient, but Tenzin's too strict. Of course, we have other valuable resources such as Kamran Ahmed's notorious [roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and Adam Golab's React specific [roadmap](https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap).

All of these resources suggest different yet similar roads. Which one to take, in the end, is going to be a judgement call.

**What will I do?**

I am highly considering starting my React journey soon with [Wes Bos'](https://wesbos.com) amazing courses, but first I might get into some Sass, Gulp, and Webpack. I think I will complement the course with articles and videos on CSS/JS Design Pattenrs and Data Structures and Algorithms. But you know me, this could change. I'll let you know how it goes.

What road do you think is the right one for you? [Let me know!](https://twitter.com/_eduardoltorres)
