This is just a quick shout-out to the amazing MongoDB University [M001: MongoDB Basics course](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about). Nothing like your code along tutorials. This is a course that **teaches** you how to use mongoDB. If you are new to mongoDB and want to get into it in the most pure manner, **this** is the course you need (it's free).

#### What I've Been Doing

During my free time, I have been fiddling with Ubuntu on a VirtualBox. Today I also learned a little bit about assembly language and a few other [Vim]({{site.url}}/vim) shortcuts. I also played this kinda CTF playground called [Microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/), if you are into hacking and stuff. I don't have much to say about this. Honestly, my brain is a bit melted after all the studying. I'll see you tomorrow.
