#### On The Leap Of Faith:
I will keep this short because there’s really not much to say: the next Leap of Faith is almost here! The blog is already built on another platform called Jekyll and I’ve migrated all of the content. It will be hosted by GitHub Pages. It is lightning fast and way easier to customize although setting it up was a bit of a pain. This means that you might see more changes than what you normally do. The next days will be cleaning days and polishing a few details here and there. I’ve decided to keep a similar minimalistic design but better delivered. I hope you’ll be able to enjoy it. I’ll see you soon in the next Leap of Faith.
