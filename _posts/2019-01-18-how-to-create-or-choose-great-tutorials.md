Have you ever taken two different tutorials on the same topic? If so, has it happened that you understand one better than the other? Why? What's the difference between them? Let's take away the fact that you already watched a tutorial on the same topic so the second one will probably be more clear. What makes one tutorial better than the other?

...oh, you're expecting me to answer? I asked you first!

I'm not a professional tutorial maker, heck, I don't even have a tutorial, but I have taken a few so I'll try my best to answer based on my experience.

While I don't have the secret sauce for making the best tutorial, I do know about one simple element that makes for me an amazing tutorial: **a tutorial where we create something real**. If it involves front-end, **extra bonus points** if it's good looking.

This might be controversial, but I think that it might ring true to more than just a few. I have taken tutorials in which we build really silly and useless projects. And I get it, the point could be just to show you how the technology works, but that is not enough for making a great tutorial.

If you create tutorials and you want to stand out, I highly suggest that you spend some time creating a real project that has the potential to be transformed by the students into something more real and more useful. A project that makes the students feel like they actually built something and not just understood some concept (remember, extra bonus points if it's a good looking front-end project).

And if you're a student, look for this in tutorials. I bet you will notice a huge difference in your learning process. And build stuff on your own over this. If you like design, play with the styles. If you prefer functionality, change its behavior or maybe add some back-end feature.

What are your thoughts on tutorials? I want to know what you think. Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eltorres720)!

#### What I've Been Doing
Yesterday, I started Wes Bos' [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course. It's the best of the best tutorials I've seen on React; I'm already halfway through. Yes, this post was inspired by his tutorials, so if you haven't given Wes a change, I highly recommend that you do. You can start with his free courses on JavaScript, Flexbox, Grid, among many others.

Like I said [yesterday]({{site.url}}/ready-for-react), I might complement React with some Sass, Gulp, Webpack and data structures and algorithms. I don't know how I will do it yet, but at the moment that is what sounds the most reasonable for me. I have been enjoying and learning a lot with the React course. I don't feel like it's too much to deal with it, on the contrary. Wes even makes comments on "if you're new to JavaScript" so he's well aware that his students are not necessarily experienced programmers.

[Let me know](https://twitter.com/eltorres720) what you think about this too. Don't be shy! ðŸ™‚
