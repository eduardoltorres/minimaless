# The Leap of Faith
The Leap of Faith--dearly referred to as 'the leap'--is the journal of a web developer. I have been documenting my self-teaching journey since the beginning. I also aim to inspire aspiring web developers. This is my story.

## Why "the leap"?
*The leap* is used to refer to the action of plunging into the web development world. After finishing grad school, I decided to take a sabbatical. [The leap](https://theleapofaith.com) is the documentation of this period.
