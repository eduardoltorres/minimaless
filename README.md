# The Leap of Faith
The Leap of Faith--dearly referred to as 'the leap' or 'LoF'--is my coding journal. I have been documenting my self-teaching journey since the beginning. I also aim to inspire others on a similar path. This is my story.

## Why "the leap"?
*The leap* is used to refer to the action of plunging into the software engineering world. After finishing grad school, I decided to take a 'sabbatical' year to pursue my passion with a professional end goal. [The leap](https://theleapofaith.com) is the documentation of this period.
